Couple of other important rules and regulation: 

<b>a.</b>You are expected to mute your microphone by default. If you have a question, type it in the chatbox on the right hand side of the Google Meet window, or raise your hand. I will check the chatbox on regular intervals. If your question is not answered adequately, you may open your microphone and ask the question verbally.

<b>b.</b>You are also expected to show decent behavior while the class is being conducted. You shall not be permitted such behaviors in the classrooms which are not permitted in Bangladeshi society. Remember even though you are online your behavior might affect other students as well as the instructor who is taking the class. The classes will be recorded, so please maintain decency.

<b>c.</b>There has been reports that students showed reluctance in wearing decent clothes while taking online classes. So be aware of that. What are decent clothes you may ask. These are attires which you would normally wear in a physical classroom of IUB. It does not has to fancy, it just has to be decent.
